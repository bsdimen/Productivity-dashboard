## Overview

WOORKIE is a task management tool designed to improve productivity by organizing daily tasks and offering a simple, clean user experience. The application allows users to create, edit, and track tasks with animations that make the interface engaging and responsive.

## Tech Stack

- **React** (Frontend)
- **TypeScript** (Type safety)
- **SCSS** (Styling)
- **Axios** (API calls)
- **Framer Motion** (Animations)
- **React Query** (Data fetching and caching)
- **JSON Server** (Mock backend during development)
- **Firebase** (Upcoming integration)

## Features

- Task creation and management
- Task filtering (completed, ongoing, etc.)
- **Pomodoro Technique** for focused work intervals
  - Users can assign an estimated time required for each task.
  - When starting a Pomodoro session, users choose a task to focus on.
  - The session is timed, with progress tracked for that specific task.
- Smooth animations for task interactions (Framer Motion)
- User-friendly design with responsive layouts
- Firebase integration for real-time updates (planned)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before running this project locally, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Steps to Set Up

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/woorkie.git

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
